# ðŸŽ„  Advent Of Code ðŸŽ„ 
In this repository I will try to fulfill all the challenges of [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)


## Getting started
1. Decide wether you want to program in local or in dev container
2. Fill `AOC_SESSION_COOKIE` with your session cookie for AOC web.
3. Run `npm run start [year] [day]`. It will run your solutions if present. Otherwise it will prepare the base code for that challenge and will download the input.txt file for it from AOC web.

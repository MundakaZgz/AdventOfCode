# ðŸŽ„  Advent Of Code ðŸŽ„ 
In this repository I will try to fulfill all the challenges of [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

In order to prepare a new year of challenges there is the `prepareYear.py` utility that can be run using
```
python3 prepareYear.py
```
This utility will create a folder named after the current year with a folder inside for each of the days in the challenge.

## Challenge status per year
|Year|Status|
